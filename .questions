1. Do I have to cite the literature the authors refer to?
e.g. The authors point to discoveries proving that a matrix
formed from spatial and temporal correlated data is approximately low rank and
can be recovered from a subset of the data.

2. Do I have to use a description environment when I dont have concise
definitions in the Terminology? I mainly discuss possible definitions.

3. Talk about my decision to see the different sensing words as synonyms.

4. How does stream sampling and reservoir sampling differ from each other?

Wikipedia: Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly
choosing a sample of k items from a list S containing n items, where n is
either a very large or unknown number. Typically, n is too large to fit the
whole list into main memory.



So in stream sensing, the schemes read some value from the data stream and
process it further. There is no real "buffer" or reservoir which is filled when
new values are added.

1. Scientific Background
	-	explain what is inside a sensor node, i.e. radio unit, sensor etc. and maybe what kind of nodes there are on the market right now (just some examples)
	- explain high level (?) use cases for sn applications, e.g. query driven, event driven
			examples: 
				- user queries sn like a db
				- bird landing in nest gets detected
				- ...

2. Definitions
	- definitions have to be added for every Section/Subsection
		- e.g. Definitions for the taxonomy apply to every class of the taxonomy, while definitions for compressive sensing are only relevant for compressive sensing

3. Synonyms
	- think about were to explain and standardize words like Data Collection, (Data) Sampling, Data Gathering, Data Sensing (some notes are in onenote @Dictionary.synonyms) 
	- Idea: Put it in the Overview of the taxonomy, as it is part of why I am including some algorithms and some not

4. Algorithm dependecies
	- start working on a dependency graph for every algorithm you read:
		- look at references and who cites this paper
		- if you find an algorithm which is already in one of the excel sheets, build a connection in a mind map tool

5. Find a suitable mind map tool

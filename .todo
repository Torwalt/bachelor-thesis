1. Scientific Background
	-	explain what is inside a sensor node, i.e. radio unit, sensor etc. and
	maybe what kind of nodes there are on the market right now (just some
	examples) - explain high level (?) use cases for sn applications, e.g.
	query driven, event driven
			examples: 
				- user queries sn like a db - bird landing in nest gets
				detected - ...
	- an energy comparison of sensing, cpu and communication maybe interesting
	(not extensive just some refrences) as to when which action consumes most
	of the energy
		-	compare maybe to other metrics such as bandwidth usage (can
			directly translate to cost if third party cloud providers are used)

2. Definitions
	- definitions have to be added for every Section/Subsection
		- e.g. Definitions for the taxonomy apply to every class of the
		taxonomy, while definitions for compressive sensing are only relevant
		for compressive sensing

3. Algorithm dependecies
	- start working on a dependency graph for every algorithm you read:
		- look at references and who cites this paper - if you find an
		algorithm which is already in one of the excel sheets, build a
		connection in a mind map tool

4. Split up Dependency Graph into Adaptive Sampling and Model Based Schemes
	- maybe use your third free graph for Compressive sampling

5. Compressive Sampling Definiton and technical introduction
	- look at definitions of CS in CS papers and if they reference some source 
		for the definition
	- maybe there is a goto paper for CS which all are referencing which can be
	used as the source of the technical introduction

6. Differentiate between sampling and sensing more => it is not a fact 
	that communication in WSNs is the main energy consumer -	networks with
	sensors that consume a lot of energy need algorithms 
		which manage sensing time
	-	 => not only sampling volume of that sensed data 

7. Rewrite synonyms section to better justify "sampling algorithm catalog", 
	i.e. why there is a filtering category and a sampling category in the
	taxonomy

8. Fix quoting

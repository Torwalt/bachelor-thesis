TODO for next push

1. Picture of the Taxonomy

2. Add Topology and Routing algorithms
    - if they cover the same topics, "combine" them into one section and adjust
    the places were you used "topology and routing algorithms"
    - additionally, add data sharing or some query processing systems
    - add 2-3 algorithms which can be used as in combinatino with the taxonomy
    algs, i.e. another clustering scheme ("We discussed a clustering scheme
    already with ASAP...")
    - sooooooo, read the topology building and routing survey papers

3. Maybe add Data Sharing into topology

General TODO

1. Distinguish work from "Energy management in wireless sensor networks with
energy-hungry sensors"
    - the paper has a taxonomy of Adaptive Sensing strategies

2. Maybe include some query processing engines for sensor networks if there are
newer ones on the level of tinyDB

3. Add maybe a prelimenary section or expand the terminology section with some
information on different use cases/types of sensor networks (can be added into
the "hardware" part), i.e. networks for continuous monitoring of some
phenomenon, networks for answering user queries (however, a user query could be
also an instruction to report readings over a long interval)

4. Maybe add after each subsection a comparison table of the algorithms you
presented. Comparisons can be made on use case, additional techniques leveraged
(e.g. clustering algorithms)...
    - however, real in depth comparisons wont be possible as it is only a high
    level overview

Backup Ideas:

1. Scientific Background
    -	explain what is inside a sensor node, i.e. radio unit, sensor etc. and
    maybe what kind of nodes there are on the market right now (just some
    examples) - explain high level (?) use cases for sn applications, e.g.
    query driven, event driven
            examples: 
                - user queries sn like a db - bird landing in nest gets
                detected - ...
    - an energy comparison of sensing, cpu and communication maybe interesting
    (not extensive just some refrences) as to when which action consumes most
    of the energy
        -	compare maybe to other metrics such as bandwidth usage (can
            directly translate to cost if third party cloud providers are used)

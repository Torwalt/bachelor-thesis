TODO for next push

1. 3-4 Algorithms in every category, finish Discussion

2. a. Rewrite synonyms section to better justify "sampling algorithm catalog", 
      i.e. why there is a filtering category and a sampling category in the
      taxonomy
   b. Rewrite sensing and sampling part, make destinction between
      usecases/sensors: 
        - Sensors can be turned on or off 
        - Sensors produce a continuous data stream which is sampled by some algorithm

3. Write an outlook (e.g. in Overview of the taxonomy) which sums up the
categories and why we devided the algorithms that way

4. Picture of the Taxonomy

5. Implement the change requests of Jonas


General TODO

1. Fix Graph Visualizations

2. Distinguish work from "Energy management in wireless sensor networks with
energy-hungry sensors"
    - the paper has a taxonomy of Adaptive Sensing strategies

3. Expand on advantages/disadvantages, use cases, and maybe problem alg tries
to solve 

4. Maybe include some query processing engines for sensor networks if there are
newer ones on the level of tinyDB

5. Add maybe a prelimenary section or expand the terminology section with some
information on different use cases/ types of sensor networks (can be added into
the "hardware" part), i.e. networks for continuous monitoring of some
phenomenon, networks for answering user queries (however, a user query could be
also an instruction to report readings over a long interval)


Backup Ideas:

1. Scientific Background
    -	explain what is inside a sensor node, i.e. radio unit, sensor etc. and
    maybe what kind of nodes there are on the market right now (just some
    examples) - explain high level (?) use cases for sn applications, e.g.
    query driven, event driven
            examples: 
                - user queries sn like a db - bird landing in nest gets
                detected - ...
    - an energy comparison of sensing, cpu and communication maybe interesting
    (not extensive just some refrences) as to when which action consumes most
    of the energy
        -	compare maybe to other metrics such as bandwidth usage (can
            directly translate to cost if third party cloud providers are used)

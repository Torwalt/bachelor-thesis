\subsection{Another entry}

The appendix (or vermiform appendix; also cecal [or caecal] appendix; vermix;
or vermiform process) is a blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which
it develops embryologically. The cecum is a pouchlike structure of the colon,
located at the junction of the small and the large intestines. The term
"vermiform" comes from Latin and means "worm-shaped". (Source: Wikipedia)

# Thoughts and Ideas

## Ideas for new categories

### Aspects on which additional division of the subcategories is possible

- Latency (Jonas)
- Datathroughoutput (Jonas)
- centralized or not (goes kind of in the direction of latency)
- divide each subclass individually, i.e. which in which aspect differ
    algorithms from each other?
  - e.g. divide adaptive sampling algorithms further into centralized and
    local, and divide model based schemes into x and y

## New Categories

### Adaptive Sampling

- autonomy from the server, i.e. no communication with the server in "normal
  mode"
  - if I take this, I have to add an algorithm which runs autonomously, as EASA
    is computed at the basestation

### Compressive Sampling

### Model Based Schemes

### Filtering Algorithms

## Overview TODO

- write the combination of algorithms section
- add some metrics with which you want to compare all the algorithms
- make table listing all algorithms of the taxonomy with the comparison metics
  - e.g. assuptions the algorithms have
- finish methodology section
  - explain why you chose the algorithms
  - describe the metrics and why you chose them
- rewrite the parts which jonas did not like
  - add a paragraph where you differentiate your work to the Energy Management
    in Wireless Sensor Networks with Energy-hungry Sensors
- classify the subcategories into additional classes based on ...

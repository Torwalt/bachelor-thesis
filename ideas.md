# Thoughts and Ideas

## Ideas for new categories

### Aspects on which additional division of the subcategories is possible

- Latency (Jonas)
- Datathroughoutput (Jonas)
- centralized or not (goes kind of in the direction of latency)
- divide each subclass individually, i.e. which in which aspect differ
    algorithms from each other?
  - e.g. divide adaptive sampling algorithms further into centralized and
    local, and divide model based schemes into x and y

## New Categories

### Adaptive Sampling

- autonomy from the server, i.e. no communication with the server in "normal
  mode"
  - if I take this, I have to add an algorithm which runs autonomously, as EASA
    is computed at the basestation

### Compressive Sampling

### Model Based Schemes

### Filtering Algorithms

## Overview TODO

- add more Visualizations to the work
  - vizu to describe sensor data gathering (kind of like a big picture)
  - some vizualizations from the papers (especially the first ones)
  - maybe find a tool which produces a vizu of paper reference connectivity,
    i.e which papers reference each other etc.
- reformulate the "combination of algorithms" section, i.e. we do not present
  possible future research directions, but present possible combinations which
  the authors theoretezize
- finish the general todo stuff
- rewrite the parts which jonas did not like
  - i.e. make it sound more "scientific writing style"
- maybe if you have time, add some more algorithms in compressive sampling and
  adaptive filtering
- expand the conclusion
- only use one synonym, i.e. only use base station for example.

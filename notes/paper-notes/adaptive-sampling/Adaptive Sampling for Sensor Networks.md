# Adaptive Sampling for Sensor Networks

## Problem/Goal

- dynamically change the sampling rates of individual sensor nodes based on the
  dynamics of the monitored environment
- reduce bandwidth usage of sensors which are not reporting important
  observations and vice versa

## Basics of Algorithm

- sampling interval (SI) = time interval between two consecutive samples
- SI is adjusted locally by the sensor nodes
  - SI is allowed to change within a sampling interval range (SIR) without
    contacting the server if:

$$ (SI_i^{last} - SIR_i/2) \geq SI_i^{desired} \geq (SI_i^{last} + SIR_i/2) $$

- the desired SI is out of bounds, the sensor node request a new SI from the
  server
  - the SIR is static and set by the user?
- the servers keeps a metric of the communication ressource avaliable which is
  changed each time a sensor node reports a change in its SI
  - server sends aknowledgement message to sensor node
- minimizing the error of ressource allocation is a linear optimization problem

## Experimental Results

- experiments where conducted on a sythetic data set generated by a
  spatio-temporal data generator
- tested metrics where:
  - proportion of vlaues send to the server and total values read by the source
  - mean fractional error between actual values and predicted (interpolated)
    ones
  - "Effective ressoure untilization" (ERU) which is the product of the above
    metrics
  - sliding window *W* which holds the last *w* values of the estimation error
- the authors tested their technique against uniform sampling (all sensor
  sample with the same SIs)
- testing was done using a different number of streaming sources
- in all cases the number of messages sent was less with the adaptive sampling
  technique than with uniform sampling and the fractional error was lower
- with varying *W* and ERU, the adaptive sampling algorithm outperfomed uniform
  sampling
  - some unexpected results where observed were adaptive sampling had much
    higher ERU than uniform sampling

## Use Cases

- sensor stream networks, not specifically wsns
- sensor networks where the data is streamed constantly to a central server

## Advantages/Disadvantages

- not extendible to multihop sensor networks (as stated by the authors)
- slinding window size and SIR has to be chosen by user
- as the authors state, the message overhead is currently high

## Compability

- proposed prediciton scheme (kalman filter) can be exchanged
- also, additional filtering algorithms (or modules) can be integrated into the
  process

## Notes

- authors differentiate data transmission and collection
  - load shedding and conventional filtering focusses on dropping already
    sensed data tuples to reduce network usage and other costs induced through
    data transmission
  - the authors technique adapts sampling rates of sensor nodes and thus the
    bandwidth distribution in the whole network based on the importance of
    sensor readings

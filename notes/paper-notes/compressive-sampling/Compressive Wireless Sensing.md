# Compressive Wireless Sensing

## Problem/Goal

- deliver a general distributed compressive sampling algorithm which trades-off generality with optimality
- when no prior knowledge exists about the characteristics of the sensed data then this algorithm will outperform other algorithms which are designed for specific kinds of data
- algorithm is agnostic of network architecture, i.e. works in both multi-hop and single-hop network environments

## Basics of Algorithm

- sensor nodes synchronize between themselves, authors argue this causes only a small energy/communication overhead

## Experimental Results

## Use Cases

## Advantages/Disadvantages


## Compability

## Notes

Authors give two solutions:

1. An optimal solution for when the designer of the nework knows the
   characteristics of the observed signal (e.g. ordering of the coefficients)
   and knows in which basis the signal is sparse
2.
